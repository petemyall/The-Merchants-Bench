    <h2>Everyday Haggling</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Every day behind the counter in a Builder's Merchants, you lose count of how often you're challenged on price:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“How much?!”</li>
        <li>“Are you sure?”</li>
        <li>“It’s cheaper down the road.”</li>
        <li>“Don’t I get my trade discount?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's constant — and it all boils down to the same thing:
        <em>“Sell it to me as cheap as you can so I can make a few quid more than I planned to.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This from a bloke pulling up in a brand-new van, off on holiday next week, while I’m still working out if I can afford a steak bake at lunchtime.
      </p>
      <p>
        When someone asked, “What’s your best price?” I’d give them a figure that made their eyebrows disappear into their hard hat. After the inevitable coughing fit, I’d grin and explain:
        <strong>“Well, that’s my best price — best for me, not for you.”</strong>
      </p>
