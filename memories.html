      <p>I started work in September 1971, straight from school with little more than an O Level in maths and absolutely no idea what a builder’s merchant was—or what one did.</p>
      <p>Back then, I was at school in Erith, just across the Thames from the massive Ford Dagenham plant. Careers advice was straightforward: if you were half decent at metalwork and woodwork, you were told to become a toolmaker. I didn't really know what a toolmaker was, either.</p>
      <p>Not that it mattered. After finishing school, I packed up and moved to join my family—who’d relocated three months earlier to Bracknell, some 40 miles away. While I sat my exams, I’d stayed with my grandmother in Chelsea. For three months I commuted across London every day: bus to Charing Cross, train to Erith, bus to school—then all over again in reverse. Character-building stuff, especially for a teenager.</p>
      <p>Those early days were a blur of learning on the job, sweeping warehouses, fetching bags of cement, and slowly getting to grips with the strange but fascinating world of building materials. It was the start of a 52-year journey—one I never saw coming, but wouldn’t trade for anything.</p>
